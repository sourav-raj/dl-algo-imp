### Feature Transformation technique to reduce the complexity of Deep Learning model

Data consists of two features along with class label.

Train two single/double hidden layer deep networks by varying the number of hidden nodes (4, 8, 12, 16) in each layer with 70% training and 30% validation data. Use appropriate learning rate, activation, and loss functions and also mention the reason for choosing the same. Report, compare, and explain the observed accuracy and minimum loss achieved.
 

Visually observe the dataset and design an appropriate feature transformation (derived feature) such that after feature transformation, the dataset can be classified using a minimal network architecture (minimum number of parameters). 

Design, train this minimal network, and report training and validation errors, and trained parameters of the network. Use 70% training and 30% validation data, appropriate learning rate, activation and loss functions. Explain the final results/
